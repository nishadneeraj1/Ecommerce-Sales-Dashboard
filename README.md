# Ecommerce Sales Dashboard

This project developed a web app to extract product reviews from Flipkart using Beautiful Soup 4. The web app allows users to enter the URL of a Flipkart product page and the scraper will extract the reviews for that product. The reviews are then displayed on the web app in a user-friendly format.
